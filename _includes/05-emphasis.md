I am currently working on a few BBS door games. These are written in C, using the OpenDoors door kit.

Some of the projects include:

- [**Crazy Eights Slot Machine**](https://github.com/DRPanther/Crazy_Eights_Slots)
- [**IdleBallz**](https://github.com/DRPanther/IdleBallz)
- [**NumberGuess**](https://github.com/DRPanther/number-guess)

...and a couple other still in development. :smirk:
