I am currently working on a few BBS door games. These are written in C, using the OpenDoors door kit.

Some of the projects include:

- [**Crazy Eights Slot Machine**](https://github.com/DRPanther/Crazy_Eights_Slots)
- [**IdleBallz**](https://github.com/DRPanther/IdleBallz)
- [**NumberGuess**](https://github.com/DRPanther/number-guess)
- [**Linux How-To Articles**](https://github.com/DRPanther/Linux-HowTo)
- [**MysticBBS Connect to QWK Networks**](https://github.com/DRPanther/MysticBBS-QWK)
- [**MysticBBS User Statistics (ANSI & MPL)**](https://github.com/DRPanther/mystic_userstats)

...and a couple other still in development...
